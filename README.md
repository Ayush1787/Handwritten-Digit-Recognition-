# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-
I've used Support . Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron, and Convolutional . Neural Network. The comparison between these algorithms is carried out on the base of their delicacy, crimes, and .testing- training time corroborated by plots and maps that have been constructed using matplotlib for visualization.

**Technology Used in the project :-**

I have developed this project using the below technology
HTML : Page layout has been designed in HTML
CSS : CSS has been used for all the desigining part
JavaScript : All the validation task and animations has been developed by JavaScript
Python : All the business logic has been implemented in Python
Flask: Project has been developed over the Flask Framework

**Datasets Details : -**

The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset.

It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28×28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.

The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively.

It is a widely used and deeply understood dataset and, for the most part, is “solved.” Top-performing models are deep learning convolutional neural networks that achieve a classification accuracy of above 99%, with an error rate between 0.4 %and 0.2% on the hold out test dataset.

Handwritten character recognition is an extensive exploration area that formerly contains detailed ways of perpetration which include major literacy datasets, popular algorithms,  . features scaling and point birth styles. MNIST dataset ( Modified National Institute of Norms and Technology database) is the subset of the NIST dataset which is a combination of two of NIST’s databases Special.  Database 1 and Special Database 3. Special Database 1 and Special Database 3 correspond of integers written by high academy scholars and workers of the United States Census Bureau,.  independently. MNIST contains a aggregate of handwritten . number images (- training set and- test set) in .  28x28 pixel bounding box andanti-aliased. All these images have corresponding Y values which apprises what the number

**Implementation Steps : -**
Import the libraries and load the dataset
Preprocess the data
Create the model
Train the model
Evaluate the model
